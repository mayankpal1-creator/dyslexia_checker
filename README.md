# Dyslexia Checker

## 📌 Project Overview
The Dyslexia Checker is a simple application designed to help identify **possible dyslexia indicators** based on reading, spelling, or text-processing patterns.  
This project is intended for **educational and screening purposes only**, not as a medical diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze user input (text / responses)
- To detect patterns commonly associated with dyslexia
- To provide basic feedback or score indicating possible difficulty

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User provides text input or completes simple reading/spelling tasks  
2. The system analyzes:
   - Letter reversal patterns
   - Spelling errors
   - Reading speed or accuracy (if applicable)
3. A result or score is generated indicating **possible dyslexia traits**
